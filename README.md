# Drug_indication_machine_learning

# Problem Statement:-
To build a classification model to predict drug name information with the help of this data set which consists of Drugs and their physical and chemical properties.

# Data information:
## Content
The opportunity is equally compelling in drug discovery, particularly in areas of high unmet need such as rare and hard-to-treat cancers and neurodegenerative conditions. Artificial intelligence can ingest and reason over information from the scientific literature and databases, as well as patient-level data, to identify potential approaches to treat diseases by proposing a drug target, designing a molecule, and defining patients in which to test that molecule to drive greater clinical success.
Here in this data set consists of physical and chemical properties of drugs with their names .This dataset is a lightly cleaned-up version of the non-proprietary version of the Drug Information Database . Some duplicate rows were removed, and column headers were renamed for brevity.
